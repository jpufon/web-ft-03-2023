    <h1>Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout</h1>
    <em>by Shel Silverstein</em>
    <hr>

    <div class="container">

        <p>
            Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout would not take the garbage out
            She'd scour the pots and scrub the pans
            Candy the yams and spice the hams
            And though her daddy would scream and shout
            She simply would not take the garbage out
        </p>

        <p>
            And so, it piled up to the ceilings
            Coffee grounds, potato peelings
            Brown bananas, rotten peas, chunks of sour cottage cheese
            That filled the can and covered the floor, cracked the window and blocked the door
        </p>

        <p>
            With bacon rinds and chicken bones, drippy ins of ice cream cones
            Prune pits, peach pits, orange peel
            Gluppy glumps of cold oat meal, pizza crust and withered greens
            And soggy beans and tangerines and crust of black burned buttered toast
            And gristly bits of beefy roast
        </p>

        <p>
            The garbage rolled on down the hall, it raised the roof, it broke the wall
            I mean, greasy napkins, cookie crumbs
            Globs of gooey bubble gums, cellophane from green baloney, rubbery blubbery macaroni, peanut butter, caked and dry
            Curdled milk and crusts of pie, moldy melons, dried-up mustard, eggshells mixed with lemon custard
            Cold french fries and rancid meat, yellow lumps of Cream of Wheat
        </p>

        <p>
            At last the garbage reached so high that it finally touched the sky
            And all the neighbors moved away
            And none of her friends would come to play
            And finally, Sarah Cynthia Stout said
            "OK, I'll take the garbage out!"
        </p>

        <p>
            But then, of course, it was too late
            The garbage reached across the state
            From New York to the Golden Gate
            And there, in the garbage she did hate
        </p>

        <p>
            Poor Sarah met an awful fate
            That I cannot, right now relate
            Because the hour is much too late
            But children, remember Sarah Stout
            And always take the garbage out
        </p>
